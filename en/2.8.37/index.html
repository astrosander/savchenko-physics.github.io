        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.8.37^*.$ A wheel of radius $R$ can rotate freely around its axis. Drive belts moving at a speed $v$ are pressed against the side surface of the wheel at a distance $h$ from the axis of rotation. Determine the steady-state angular velocity of the wheel if its contact with the drive belt occurs only along the rim.

<p>
From the geometry of the problem
$$\left\{\begin{matrix}
\frac{h}{R} = \cos\alpha \\
\frac{u}{v} = \cos\alpha
\end{matrix}\right.$$
Considering the relationship between velocity $u$ and angular velocity $\omega$
$$\left\{\begin{matrix}
\frac{h}{R} = \frac{u}{v} \\
u=\omega R
\end{matrix}\right.$$
From where
$$\boxed{\omega=\frac{hv}{R^2}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$\omega=\frac{hv}{R^2}$$
