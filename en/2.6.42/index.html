        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.6.42^*.$ The plane of the satellite's orbit is divided into sectors with a common vertex in the center of the planet of mass $M$ and the same small solution angles $d \varphi$. Find the change in the satellite's speed as it passes through each sector, if its speed is in the pericenter $v_p$, and the distance from the satellite to the center of the planet is in the pericenter $r_p$.

<p>

For a short time, $dt$, the body moves along the arc of the circle of arc $d\varphi$ with radius-curvature of the trajectory $R_n$.</p><p>
Newton's second law for an external force, the gravitational force
$$ma=\frac{GmM}{R_n^2}$$
By definition of acceleration
$$a=\frac{dv}{dt}\Rightarrow \frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{GM}{R_n^2}\quad (1)$$
In a small amount of time
$$R_n=v_ndt\quad (2)$$
By definition the arc length of the circle corresponding to the angle $d\varphi$
$$dR=d\varphi \cdot R_n\quad (3)$$
After substituting $(2)$ and $(3)$ into $(1)$
$$\frac{dv}{dR}v_n=\frac{GM}{R_n^2}\Rightarrow \frac{dv}{d\varphi}v_n=\frac{GM}{R_n}$$
After the transformation, we can get a change in the satellite's speed
$$\boxed{dv=\frac{GM\cdot d\varphi}{R_nv_n}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $dv=\gamma Md\varphi/(v_{\mathrm{n}}r_{\mathrm{n}})$. The vector $dv$ is directed towards the centre of the planet
