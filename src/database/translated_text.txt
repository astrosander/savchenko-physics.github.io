<p>a) If the distances between two points are constant, then if we project the velocity of point $A$ onto line $AB$, then the projection of the velocity of point $B$ onto line $AB$ is exactly the same</p>
<p class="exp">$\fbox{$u_{AB} = v/\sqrt{2}$}$</p>

<p>Ð±) The velocities of $A$ and $B$ are the same because either the body does not rotate, or its rotation occurs around line $AB$. </p>
<p>The fact that the velocity of point $C$ has a different value indicates that its velocity $\vec u$ is made up of the velocity $\vec v$ in the plane of the figure and $\vec u_1$ perpendicular to the plane.</a>
<p class="exp">$\vec{u}_1+\vec{v} = \vec{u}$</p>
<p>From where</a>
<p class="exp">$\fbox{$u_1 = \sqrt{u^2 - v^2}$}$</p>
